Module "FLASH1"    (component FLASH_LDD)
   - FLASH1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" property is set to "yes" 
                (<Enabled in init. code>) value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In 
                this case the Enable() method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once.
                Before the second call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - FLASH1_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - FLASH1_Write -This method sets up a flash memory write operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (tproperty <Write batch size>) by periodical calling the component’s Main method in the user application 
                (higher level OS service) or by the component’s ISR, if an component’s interrupt service is enabled.
   - FLASH1_GetOperationStatus -Returns a status of current (last) flash memory operation.
   - FLASH1_Main -This method is used to perform one batch of a flash memory operation operation. This method is used to 
                perform batches of all flash memory operations (Write, Read, Erase, EraseBlock, VerifyErasedBlock) when the 
                component works in the polled mode (interrupt service is disabled - property <Interrupt service>). This method 
                performs batches of the read flash memory operation, when the component works in the interrupt triggered mode 
                (interrupt service is enabled). This method is enabled only if the component works in the polled mode or if the 
                Read method is enabled.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK60DN512MD10)

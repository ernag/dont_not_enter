Module "PORTB_GPIO" (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - PORTB_GPIO_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "PORTC_GPIO" (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - PORTC_GPIO_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "PORTE_GPIO" (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - PORTE_GPIO_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "PORTD_GPIO" (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - PORTD_GPIO_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK60DN512MC10)
   - Cpu_GetLLSWakeUpFlags -This method returns the current status of the LLWU wake-up flags indicating which wake-up source 
                caused the MCU to exit LLS or VLLSx low power mode.   The following predefined constants can be used to 
                determine the wake-up source:   LLWU_EXT_PIN0, ... LLWU_EXT_PIN15 - external pin 0 .. 15 caused the wake-up   
                LLWU_INT_MODULE0 .. LLWU_INT_MODULE7 - internal module 0..15 caused the wake-up.

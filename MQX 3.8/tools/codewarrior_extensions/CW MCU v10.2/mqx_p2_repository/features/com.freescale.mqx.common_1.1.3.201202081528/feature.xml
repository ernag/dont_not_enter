      FREESCALE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
This is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or as an authorized representative of your
employer) and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (&quot;Freescale&quot;).  It concerns your rights to use this file and 
any accompanying written materials (the &quot;Software&quot;).  This Agreement does not concern your rights for 
software that has its own separate license agreement.   A list of these license agreements is available at
www.freescale.com/codewarrior/LicenseNotice and is included with this software as a readme file. In 
consideration for Freescale allowing you to access the Software, you are agreeing to be bound by the 
terms of this Agreement.  If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not activate or 
install the Software.  If you change your mind later, stop using the Software and delete all copies of the 
Software in your possession or control.  Any copies of the Software that you have already distributed, 
where permitted, and do not destroy will continue to be governed by this Agreement.  Your prior use 
will also continue to be governed by this Agreement.

1. LICENSE GRANT.  
Your rights to use this Software vary depending upon the particular version of the Software product that
you licensed.  If you do not remember this information you may contact the party from whom you
obtained the Software or us at www.freescale.com. This information is also contained in the license file
created when you install the Software.

a.  Evaluation Period  The Software may allow you to install it on a machine without paying a
license fee.  The Software will operate until a certain time elapses (&quot;Evaluation Period&quot;) and will then
automatically disable itself.  Until then, Freescale grants to you the non-transferable right to install the
software onto a single computer and to use the Software on that computer.  You may not use the
Software for commercial purposes during the Evaluation Period.

b.  Post Evaluation Period    
Node Locked License. If you purchased a node locked license (including a free license),
then Freescale grants to you the non-transferable right to install and use the Software on one
computer. 

Floating &amp; &quot;Dongle&quot;  Licenses.  If you purchased a floating or &quot;dongle&quot; license
(including a free license), then Freescale grants to you the non-transferable right to install the
Software on any number of computers and to simultaneously use a number of copies equal to
the number of licenses that you purchased. A dongle means an electronic device that plugs into
one of the communication ports of your computer.  The product will automatically limit you to
the correct number of simultaneous users.   You may not interfere with this automated process.

Academic Licenses.  If you purchased an &quot;Academic&quot; license, then you may not use the
Software for commercial purposes.  You may only use the Software to teach and to perform
research within an accredited educational institution.  

c.  Limited Distribution Rights  For node locked, floating and dongle licenses, Freescale also
grants to you the right to prepare derivative works of and to distribute Compiled Software in object
(machine-readable) form only and only as part of your own software programs that add substantial value
to the Compiled Software.  You may only distribute the Compiled Software for execution on processors
sold by Freescale, directly or through distribution, and processors that are compatible with the RS08
instruction set architecture (&quot;Freescale Processor&quot;).  Compiled Software means the portion of the
Software that is executable on a Freescale Processor, such as an embedded operating system, standard or
&quot;MSL&quot; libraries, runtime libraries, example code and stationery code.   Other components may also be
distributed only if they are explicitly so marked in conjunction with that installed component.    

2. LIMITATIONS.  If you benchmark the Software against other programs, then you may not
publicly disclose your results.  You may not translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble
Software provided to you solely in object form except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits
such restriction. In addition, you must prohibit your customers from doing the same.  If you violate any
of the terms or restrictions of this Agreement, Freescale may immediately terminate this Agreement, and
require that you stop using and delete all copies of the Software in your possession or control.

3. TERM.  If you purchased a term license, then the Software will automatically disable itself after
the term expires.  However, you may continue to distribute Compiled Software.  If you purchased a
perpetual license, then you may use the Software for as long as you like.

4. COPYRIGHT.  The Software is licensed to you, not sold.  Freescale owns the Software, and
United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions protect the Software. Therefore, you
must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material (e.g. a book or musical recording). You may
not use or copy the Software for any other purpose than what is described in this Agreement. Except as
expressly provided herein, Freescale does not grant to you any express or implied rights under any
Freescale or third party patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets. Additionally, you must
reproduce and apply any copyright or other proprietary rights notices included on or embedded in the
Software to any copies or derivative works made thereof, in whole or in part, if any.

5. PRODUCT SUGGESTIONS &amp; SUPPORT.  Freescale is NOT obligated to provide any support,
upgrades or new releases of the Software under this Agreement. If you wish, you may contact Freescale
and report problems and provide suggestions regarding the Software.  You agree that Freescale may use
your suggestions to improve the Software.  Freescale has no obligation whatsoever to respond in any
way to such a problem report or suggestion. Freescale may make changes to the Software at any time,
without any obligation to notify or provide updated versions of the Software to you.

6. WARRANTY.  For a period of 90 days following delivery, Freescale only warrants that
the media on which the Software is provided, if any, will be free from defects in material and
workmanship.  THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THE WARRANTY
AGAINST INFRINGEMENT SPECIFIED IN THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.  ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMED, TO THE FULL EXTENT THESE MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW.  
If the media is not as warranted, Freescale will, at
its option, and as your exclusive remedy, either refund the purchase price, repair, or replace
with the same or equivalent Software that meet this warranty.  Freescale&apos;s obligations to correct
errors in the Software will be separately contained in a maintenance and support agreement.

7. YOUR INDEMNITY TO FREESCALE.  You agree to defend and indemnify, at your expense,
Freescale from any and all claims, liabilities, and costs (including reasonable attorney&apos;s fees) related to
(1) your use (including your sublicensee&apos;s use, if permitted) of the Software or (2) your violation of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

8. FREESCALE&apos;S INDEMNITY TO YOU.  Freescale agrees to defend, at Freescale&apos;s
expense, any Suit against you, and will indemnify you for costs and damages (including
reasonable attorneys&apos; fees) finally awarded in the Suit.  &quot;Suit&quot; means a lawsuit based on a
Claim.  &quot;Claim&quot; means a claim that the Software directly infringes a U.S. patent or copyright,
or misappropriates a trade secret.  Freescale will have no obligation to defend or indemnify you
unless you: (i) promptly notifies Freescale in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after you
first become aware of the Claim; and (ii) give Freescale sole control of the Suit and all
requested assistance for defending the Suit.  Freescale will not be liable for the settlement of a
Claim made without Freescale&apos;s prior written consent.  Freescale will have no obligation to
defend or indemnify you if: (i) you or any third party has altered the Software, and the alleged
infringement would not have occurred but for such alteration; (ii) you or any third party has
combined the Software with any other products or elements not furnished by Freescale, and the
alleged infringement would not have occurred but for such combination; or (iii) the Software
was designed or manufactured in compliance with standards issued by a public standards body,
and the alleged infringement would not have occurred but for such standards.  If the use or
permitted resale of any Software is enjoined as a result of a Suit, Freescale, at Freescale&apos;s
option, and at no expense to you, will: (i) obtain for you the right to use or distribute the
Software; (ii) substitute an equivalent product(s) reasonably acceptable to you and extend this
indemnity to that product(s); or (iii) accept the return of the Software and refund the purchase
price paid for the Product to you, less a reasonable charge for prior use, if any.  Freescale will
not be liable for damages in excess of (i) a reasonable royalty rate on the Software that is the
subject of the Claim, multiplied by (ii) the revenue derived by Freescale from license to you of
the Software.  THIS SECTION CONTAINS (I) FREESCALE&apos;S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS RELATED
TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION, AND (II) YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES
AGAINST FREESCALE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION.  

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  FREESCALE&apos;S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL
COSTS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, INDEMNIFIABLE CLAIMS, OR LOSSES WHATSOEVER
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR PRODUCT(S)
SUPPLIED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR
THE SOFTWARE.

10. DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT WILL FREESCALE
BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE,
COMMERCIAL LOSS, OR LOST PROFITS, SAVINGS, OR REVENUES TO THE FULL EXTENT
SUCH MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW.

11. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must use the Software in
accordance with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations and statutes.  You agree that neither you nor your
licensees (if any) intend to or will, directly or indirectly, export or transmit the Software to any country
in violation of U.S. export restrictions. 

12. GOVERNMENT USE.  If you distribute the Software to the United States Government,
where permitted, then the Software is &quot;restricted computer software&quot; and is subject to FAR
52.227-19 (c)(1) and (c)(2).   

13. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.  You acknowledge that the Software is not fault tolerant and is not
designed, manufactured or intended by Freescale for incorporation into products intended for use or
resale in on-line control equipment in hazardous, dangerous to life or potentially life-threatening
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines or weapons
systems, in which the failure of products could lead directly to death, personal injury or severe physical
or environmental damage (&quot;High Risk Activities&quot;). You specifically represent and warrant that you will
not use the Software or any derivative work of the Software for High Risk Activities. 

14. CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE; LIMITATIONS.  You agree that the statutes and laws of the
United States and the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflicts of laws principles, will apply to
all matters relating to this Agreement or the Software, and you agree that any litigation will be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Texas, USA.  You agree that regardless of any
statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the Software must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
barred.

15. PRODUCT LABELING.  You are not authorized to use any Freescale trademarks, brand names,
or logos.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and
Freescale regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior communications,
negotiations, understandings, agreements or representations, either written or oral, if any.  This
Agreement may only be amended in written form, executed by you and Freescale.

17. SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be invalid or
unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and, unless a
modification or replacement of the invalid or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or
Freescale of a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately terminate, the invalid or
unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
closest to the intention underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision.

18. NO WAIVER.  The waiver by Freescale of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent breach of the same or a different
provision.

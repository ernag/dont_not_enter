/*FUNCTION*-------------------------------------------------------------------
* 
* Function Name    : _task_reserve_space
* Returned Value   : Byte offset from reserved area base address
* Comments         : 
*   This function reserves 'size' bytes that will be added to the size
* of every task's stack.  It can be thought of as a way of allocating
* "task local storage" or perhaps as a way of dynamically adding to the
* TD_STRUCT.  Both "OS Changer" and the MetaWare C/C++ runtime want
* additional per-task variables.  However, this is a general feature that
* can be used for many more purposes.
*
*     NOTE: The space added to each task must be known before ANY
*           tasks are created.
*
* See also ta_gtos.c and td_alloc.c.

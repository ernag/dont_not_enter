* Comments:
*
*   This file is the main file for filesystem demo. Note that this example
*   is a multi tasking example and needs an operating system to run. This 
*   means that customers who are not using MQX should change the operating system
*   dependent code. An attempt has been made to comment out the code
*   however, a programmer must review all lines of code to ensure that
*   it correctly compiles with their libraries of operating system and
*   targetcompiler. This program has been compiled and tested for ARC AA3
*   processor with MQX real time operating system.

/*FUNCTION*----------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Function Name  : CFCard_task
* Returned Value : None
* Comments       :
*     This rutine controls CompactFlash card insert and remove events
*     CompactFlash driver consists from two parts:
*             - lower layer (platform dependend) "pccarda:" driver can be open 
*               even if the CF card is not inserted
*             - upper layer (platform independend) "pcflasha:" driver should be 
*               opened only when card is present in the slot.Otherwise error is 
*               reported during fopen("pcflasha",..) function call.
